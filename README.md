Hello dear visitor, welcome to my personal projects repository. Here you'll find a list with some of my personal projects and experiments that are available online.

This is only stuff I've done for fun in my free time. If you're looking for my professional experience and projects, open my [CV](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2hOO8PX6CgfamxFMUo3SmF4S2M/edit).

[JDonado's README](https://blog.jdonado.com/): my blog, where I talk about software.

[My personal web (jdonado.com)](https://www.jdonado.com/): here you'll find a bit of information about how I write software, as well as a list with the contents of my blog, some of my pictures and some of my music tracks.

[Speaky MiniPlayer](https://github.com/fjrd84/speaky-miniplayer): A robotic mini player for Spotify, [available for Windows, Linux and MacOSX](https://github.com/fjrd84/speaky-miniplayer/releases).
